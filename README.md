Uptime Slack webhook plugin
======================

This Uptime (https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime) plugin notifies all configured events (up, down, paused, restarted) by sending a HTTPS POST request to to a slack.com URL.

To use the plugin, first install it using npm while in the Uptime directory:

```sh
$ npm install uptime-slack
```

Then to enable it, add it to the `plugins/index.js`, as follows:

```js
// in plugins/index.js
exports.init = function() {
  require('uptime-slack').init();
}
```

Customize the plugin settings in the `config/production.yaml` configuration file, as in the example below:

```yaml
webhooks:
  event:
    up:
      - 'https://xxxx.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=xxxxxx'
    down:
      - 'https://xxxx.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=xxxxxx'
    paused:
      - 'https://xxxx.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=xxxxxx'
    restarted:
      - 'https://xxxx.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=xxxxxx'
  dashboardUrl: 'http://uptime.example.com'
  channel:      '#slack-channel'
